# React & Vite Boilerplate with Context API

Welcome to the `react-vite-use-context-boiler-plate`!

This boilerplate is meticulously crafted to jumpstart your React projects, integrating Vite for rapid development and the React Context API for robust state management. This guide offers a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, components, and especially its state management approach. As a student of Technigo, you'll find this guide helpful in navigating and utilizing the repository.

## Demo

[You can check out a Demo of this boilerplate here.](https://react-vite-use-context-boiler-plate.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Navigating the Repository

### Core App: `src/App.jsx`

The epicenter of the application. It showcases:

- Reactive Components: Components that respond dynamically to state changes.
- Child Component Integration: Demonstrating how child components integrate and receive data.

### Components: `src/components/`

A collection of reusable components:

- Logos: Display logos with associated links.
- Home: A potential landing page component.
- QuotesDisplay: Showcase quotes or testimonials.
- ComponentWithCss: An example of integrating CSS with a component.

### Contexts: `src/contexts/`

Centralized state management using the Context API:

- BoilerPlateContext: A sample context for boilerplate data.
- BookContext: A sample context for book data.

### Providers: `src/providers/`

- AppProviders.jsx: A hub where all context providers converge. This ensures a streamlined integration into the main application and facilitates easy management of global states.

### Styling: `src/index.css`

Universal styles for the application.

## State Management in Depth

This boilerplate employs the React Context API for state management, providing a centralized store for our application's data. Here's how it's implemented:

- Context Creation: Contexts like `BoilerPlateContext` and `BookContext` are created using `React.createContext()`. These contexts hold the data and functions to manipulate that data.

- Providers: The `src/providers/AppProviders.jsx` file wraps the entire app with these contexts, ensuring any component within the app can access the data or functions they provide.

- Consuming Context: Components can tap into these contexts using the `useContext` hook, allowing them to both read the state and dispatch actions to update it.

- Centralized State Management: By using the Context API, the state is lifted up and managed centrally, ensuring data consistency and eliminating the need to pass down props through multiple component layers.

Tip: Before diving deep into development, familiarize yourself with the existing components and contexts. They serve as practical templates and can be the foundation for your components and state management.

We hope this guide helps you navigate and make the most out of this boilerplate.

Happy coding, Technigo students!
