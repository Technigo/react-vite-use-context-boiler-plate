Welcome to the `react-vite-use-context-boiler-plate`!

This boilerplate is meticulously crafted to jumpstart your React projects, integrating Vite for rapid development and the React Context API for robust state management. This guide offers a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, components, and especially its state management approach. As a student of Technigo, you'll find this guide helpful in navigating and utilizing the repository.

## Navigating the Repository

### Main Entry: `src/main.jsx`

The gateway to the application. It integrates the entire app with necessary providers and renders the primary `App` component.

### Core App: `src/App.jsx`

The epicenter of the application. It showcases:

- Reactive Components: Components that respond dynamically to state changes.
- Static Data Rendering: Display static content with ease.
- Child Component Integration: Demonstrating how child components integrate and receive data.

### Components: `src/components/`

A collection of reusable components:

- Logos: Display logos with associated links.
- Home: A potential landing page component.
- QuotesDisplay: Showcase quotes or testimonials.
- ComponentWithCss: An example of integrating CSS with a component.

### Contexts: `src/contexts/`

Centralized state management using the Context API:

- BoilerPlateContext: A sample context for boilerplate data.
- BookContext: Handle book-related data and functionalities.

### Providers: `src/providers/`

- AppProviders.jsx: A hub where all context providers converge. This ensures a streamlined integration into the main application and facilitates easy management of global states.

### Styling: `src/index.css`

Universal styles for the application.
