# React & Vite Boilerplate with Context API

Welcome to the `react-vite-use-context-boiler-plate`!

This boilerplate is meticulously crafted to jumpstart your React projects, integrating Vite for rapid development and the React Context API for robust state management. This guide offers a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, components, and especially its state management approach. As a student of Technigo, you'll find this guide helpful in navigating and utilizing the repository.

## Demo

[You can check out a Demo of this boilerplate here.](https://react-vite-use-context-boiler-plate.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Navigating the Repository

- Main App (`src/App.jsx`): This is the core of the application. It orchestrates the rendering of various components and may also manage some shared state or logic. It's the central hub from which other components are called and displayed.

- Components (`src/components/`): This directory houses all the reusable UI components. Each component is designed for a specific UI task, like displaying a list or rendering a button. They can be combined in various ways to create complex UIs.

- Data Management (`src/contexts/`): Contexts are a way to manage and share state across components. In this directory, you'll find various contexts like `BoilerPlateContext` and `BookContext`, which manage data and provide functions to update that data.

- Providers (`src/providers/`): The `AppProviders.jsx` file is crucial for state management. It wraps the entire app with the created contexts, ensuring that any component, no matter how deeply nested, can access and modify the shared state.

## State Management in Depth

This boilerplate employs the React Context API for state management, providing a centralized store for our application's data. Here's how it's implemented:

- Context Creation: Contexts like `BoilerPlateContext` and `BookContext` are created using `React.createContext()`. These contexts hold the data and functions to manipulate that data.

- Providers: The `src/providers/AppProviders.jsx` file wraps the entire app with these contexts, ensuring any component within the app can access the data or functions they provide.

- Consuming Context: Components can tap into these contexts using the `useContext` hook, allowing them to both read the state and dispatch actions to update it.

- Centralized State Management: By using the Context API, the state is lifted up and managed centrally, ensuring data consistency and eliminating the need to pass down props through multiple component layers.

Tip: Before diving deep into development, familiarize yourself with the existing components and contexts. They serve as practical templates and can be the foundation for your components and state management.

We hope this guide helps you navigate and make the most out of this boilerplate.

Happy coding, Technigo students!
